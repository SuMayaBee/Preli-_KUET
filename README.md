Hackathon Preliminary Challenges - BitFest 2025
Challenge 1: Banglish-to-Bengali Transliteration
Problem Statement
Iqbal needs a solution to convert Banglish (Bengali written in English characters) to Bengali script after losing access to a Bengali typing tool. This challenge involves training a sequence-to-sequence model for transliteration.

Solution
Dataset Preparation
Dataset Used: SKNahin/bengali-transliteration-data.
The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
Model
Model Type: mBART (Multilingual BART)
Why mBART? It is pre-trained on multilingual text, making it suitable for low-resource language tasks like Banglish-to-Bengali transliteration.
Workflow
Preprocessing

Tokenized Banglish and Bengali text using sequence-to-sequence tokenization.
Cleaned the data by filtering excessively long or short sentences.
Training

Fine-tuned mBART using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Hyperparameters:
Learning Rate: 5e-5
Batch Size: 16
Epochs: 5
Framework: PyTorch.
Model Storage

The trained model is stored in the GitHub repository under the Model directory.
Deliverables
Trained Model: GitHub Repository - Model Directory
Jupyter Notebook: Located in the Challenge1 directory as banglish_transliteration.ipynb.
Challenge 2: Mofaâ€™s Kitchen Buddy
